<p>Every day, we're bombarded with statistics on economics, politics, science, etc. But too often, numbers go in one eye and out the other. So the question is:</p>

<p><b>How do you make statistics more sticky?</b></p>

<p>Take a wild guess on these three stats:</p>

<p>// interactive</p>

<p>This guessing game was part of <a href="">a randomized controlled web-experiment</a> I did earlier this month. Inspired by New York Times' <a href="">You Draw It</a>, I wanted to see if predicting a statistic <i>before</i> seeing it makes it more memorable.</p>

<p>Here was my experimental design:</p>

<p><img src="design.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Both groups see 10 statistics about the world, in random order. Why 10? Because I wanted to overload short-term memory, which cognitive scientists have estimated can only hold 7±2 "chunks".* (Or maybe 3±1*)</p>

<p>Previous studies have already shown that confronting your misconceptions helps you learn better, whether that's directly[muller] or indirectly through prediction[crouch, hullman]. So, <a href="">when I "pre-registered" my experiment</a>, I hypothesized that "predict it first" should create a <i>small</i> increase in memory retention.</p>

<p>But when I analyzed the data (N=1000+ responses), to my great surprise...</p>

<p>Well... what do <i>you</i> predict happened?</p>

<p>// interactive</p>

<p>That's right: <i>null result.</i></p>

<p>(sad trombone)</p>

<p>So after performing the scientific protocol of "moping around for a few days", I embraced the null. Because, this null <i>was</i> puzzling. People in the experimental "predict it first" group reported <i>liking</i> the content more (d=0.55, p&lt;0.001), and reported being <i>surprised</i> more (d=0.51, p&lt;0.001)... <b>and yet that's <i>still not sufficient</i> for helping people <i>remember</i> more.</b>[animation study]</p>

<p><img src="metrics2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Therefore, my experiment (with its null result) must have had something different from all the previous "confront your misconceptions first" experiments (with their positive results)[crouch, huller, muller].</p>

<p>I think the big difference was this: <b>all the other studies taught &amp; tested people on ONE topic.</b> Whether that's quantum mechanics, voter demographics, smartphone prices – they showed information on a single topic, and never mixed topics.</p>

<p>In contrast, my experiment showed <i>10 different stats in 10 different topics</i> in five minutes. I think I got exactly what I wished for: I overloaded short-term memory. If "predict it first" had any effect, it would have been wiped out by the sheer cognitive load of trying to hold 10 unrelated facts in one's head.</p>

<p>In hindsight, that sounds like an obvious mistake, but "cram lots of ideas in a short time" <i>is what a lot of online educational content does.</i> Top 10 Lists, lightning-pace YouTube videos, etc. My null result implies a hard lesson for "educational content" makers: <b>no matter how interesting or surprising you make your content, if you go against basic cognitive science principles, it'll all be for naught.</b></p>

<p>I've been making "interactive explainers" for years. I think it'd be good for me to keep doing these (admittedly amateur) cognitive science experiments. Practice without theory can get lost down a blind alley, theory without practice can get lost in the clouds. Maybe by doing both, I can help the two fields learn from each other.</p>

<p>That's my hypothesis, anyway.</p>

<p>It's time to test that.</p>
